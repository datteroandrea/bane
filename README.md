# About

A RAT terminal creator/handler

# How it works

Bane consists of 3 main components:

- Bane the initial terminal interface
- RAT the shell interface which enables you to create, customize RAT
- Shell the rat interface which enables you to control remotely victims

# Requirements

- Java version 8
- Linux/Mac OS it is also fully working for Windows but the terminal interface is not perfectly compatible yet.

# Setup

If you are on a Linux-like system you can use install.sh to add bane as the command otherwise you can use Bane anyway by typing

`java -jar bane.jar`

# Usage

Initially you will be welcomed by the Bane interface there you can choose to use the RAT Interface or the Shell Interface.
